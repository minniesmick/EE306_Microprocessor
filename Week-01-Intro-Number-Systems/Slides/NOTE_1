--Combinational Circuit v Sequential Circuit--

  Combinational Circuit is memoryless and only depends the input(s). ALU-Decoder-Mux is in this type

  Sequential Circuit works with memory , Flip Flops, RAM- Control Unit is this type.

Let say Decoder has "n" inputs then it has 2^n=8 outputs.
Registers have 32 flip flops to store data's.
Control Unit decides that next process will be "execution" or "fetch".
Instruction Register works with Control Unit.

  **Example**
  Describe the process that, 2 integer that located on RAM. summation of them will bew placed on 3'rd register which r2.

     :: load command for gathering values from RAM to registers ( r0 and r1) 
     :::fetch:: CU says load means loading values from RAM
     :::decode:::execution--> that address of the ram and it needs to be read, Ram outs adress' value to data bus , finally   
        r0 and r1 have the values.
    :: addition of r0 and r1::
    :::add r2, r1, r0
    :::CU fetch and decodes add as addition so it calls ALU(combinational) , ALU gets values of R0 and R1 and sums them at last 
   puts the result on r2.
